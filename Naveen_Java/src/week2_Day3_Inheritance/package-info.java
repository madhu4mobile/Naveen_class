/* INheritance talks about how child classeses inherits properties from parents
 * 1. child can only have a parent. Not multile parents
 * 2. Child can inherit from parent. Can not inherit directly from grand parent.
 *  If a child has to inherit some thing from grand parent, first parent has to inherit and then the child will inherit
 * 3. A child can not inherit from a sibling too.
 *
 * For ex, if car is parent to BMW, Audi, Merk.. then the siblings cannot inherit from each other.
 *
 * final keyword is used to stop the others from inheritance from the others.
